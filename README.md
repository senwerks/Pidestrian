# Pedestrian Lights

A Raspberry Pi Pico connected to a 240V Relay board with 2 relays, each of which are connected to 240V LED spotlights inside a set of Pedestrian Crossing lights (the red/green person lights to cross an intersection). I'll upload more details, photos, wiring diagrams etc Soonâ„¢.

## Notes

There's an "online.py" and "offline.py", the former connects to Wifi and serves a web app with controls for the lights, and the latter is a simpler timer based system using a physical button to trigger mode changes.

Rename one to "main.py" and copy it to the RPi Pico (online.py requires a Pico W, offline.py can use a Pico W or normal Pico). Read the notes in the files for config changes.
